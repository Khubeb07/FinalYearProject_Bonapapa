                <h2>Newborn Baby Care</h2>
                <p>Taking care of a newborn requires gentleness, attention, and lots of love. Keep your baby’s skin clean and dry by using soft, breathable Bonapapa diapers, and change them frequently to avoid rashes. Use Bonapapa wipes, specially designed to be mild, hypoallergenic, and gentle on delicate skin. Always handle your baby with clean hands, and make sure their surroundings are warm, safe, and peaceful. Bonding through cuddles, soothing words, and eye contact helps build emotional connection in those precious early days.</p>

                <h2>Healthy Eating Habits</h2>
                <p>Nutrition plays a key role in your baby’s growth and development. In the early months, ensure your baby is breastfed or formula-fed on a regular schedule to provide essential nutrients. As they grow, gradually introduce age-appropriate solid foods, starting with soft purees and progressing to easy-to-grasp finger foods. Avoid sugary or highly processed snacks. Establishing a consistent mealtime routine helps your baby explore flavors and textures while building a foundation for lifelong healthy eating habits.</p>

                <h2>Better Sleep for Babies</h2>
                <p>A well-rested baby is a happy baby. Set a calming bedtime routine with a warm bath, a fresh Bonapapa diaper, gentle lullabies, and dim lighting to help your little one wind down. Make sure the sleeping area is quiet, safe, and comfortable. Bonapapa diapers provide all-night dryness and leak protection, allowing your baby to sleep soundly without interruptions. Maintain consistent nap and bedtime schedules during the day to support a healthy sleep cycle.</p>
